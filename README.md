## Versions

## a0.11[5/11/24]
I'm not a full year late, but pretty close. :D

I'm back, with a major code refactor and nothing new.

### How much has Evan refactored?
* [X] Chocolate
* [X] Customers
* [ ] Ingredients
* [ ] Byte Mining
* [ ] Projects 

### ALPHA v0.10.2 (7/22/24)

**NOTES:**
Man, I rushed the last update

**CHANGES:**
* Adjusted how fast byte mining happens after upgrading power

**BUG FIXES:**
* Fixed bug where the price of memory said $100 at the start
* Fixed game over screen not showing and the background going black (that is a pretty cool effect though)
* Fixed bug where you couldn't buy power
* Fixed the weird byte mining power thing
* Gaining bytes now goes at a steady rate (oh wait this is actually imposible)

### ALPHA v0.10.1 (7/20/24)

**NOTES:**
I am very smart. 

**BUG FIXES:**
* Fixed the version name being wrong
* Removed unused and untested feature

### ALPHA v0.10.0 (7/20/24)

**NOTES:**
Oops. Looks like I forgot about Chocolate Factory for a month or so. The next update: A second information upgrade and a fix to the weird byte mining power thing

**FEATURES:**
* Added a new project that tells you if you're making money
* Added a project that shows marketing
* Added a favicon

**CHANGES:**
* Removed debug menu. I'm sorry.
* Adjusted project prices
* Adjusted memory upgrade price
* Reworked project system (increasing memory only increases by 100)

**BUG FIXES:**
* Fixed weird bug where the chocolate buttons click strangely on a soft-touch trackpad
* Made each column able to scroll indepentently to stop things from going off-screen


### ALPHA v0.9.1 (6/24/24)

**NOTES:**
Apparently the new update did mess things up. Also apparently if you click on stuff in the change product seller tooltips their background turns black??? I feel like I should've made this an update instead of a patch. It escalated quickly :)

**CHANGES:**
* Changed the way the project displays look
* The project displays are now unclickable if you don't have enough bytes

**BUG FIXES:**
* Fixed bug where the dark chocolate project text went slightly below the project box
* Fixed issue where you could buy the dark chocolate project even if you don't have enough bytes
* Fixed strange bug where it always says you don't have enough bytes when you buy a project but the project activates anyway
* Fixed issue where the bubble telling you to 'change the product seller...' doesn't go away ever
* Fixed weird problem where the byte count can go up to one more than the maximum

### ALPHA v0.9.0 (6/23/24)
**NOTES:**
Adding new chocolates required a full rework of the money and bar system. Everything's probably borken :/

**FEATURES:**
* Added a new type of chocolate (finally)

**CHANGES:**
* Reworked the customer pay systems
* Reworked the WHOLE FRICKING GAME

**BUG FIXES:**
* Made the name changing feature less buggy

### ALPHA v0.8.0 (6/15/24)
**NOTES:**
I think I've removed most of the bugs. From now on I'm just going to work on more project-related things. Any suggestions on projects or the rightmost column? Email me at evanwarnerlee@gmail.com. 

**FEATURES:**
* Added the ability to name your shop
* Added a game over screen (it's a placeholder for now)

**CHANGES:**
* Changed debug keys to [ and \] so they wouldn't interfere with naming the shop
* Added a visual indicator for when you increase the byte mining power
* The change seller feature is not unlocked right away anymore

**BUG FIXES:**
* Renamed ROWS to COLUMNS in the code (You know those columns that make up the game? I had a small-brain moment and labelled them "rows".)
* Made it so you have to have bought a worker to buy the boxes project
* Added a display for adaptive pricing of the byte mining power upgrade (the circuits look more powerful!)
* Fixed issue where the bubble text displayed under the locked columns


### ALPHA patch v0.7.2
**NOTES:**
oops. Again.

**BUGS:**
* Made the version name say the right thing
* Refactored some code to make the game 0.5 milliseconds faster
* Fixed some extra chocolate code


### ALPHA patch v0.7.1
**NOTES:**
oops.

**BUGS:**
* Fixed fatal error where the boxes display was always visible
* Fixed more font issues


### ALPHA v0.7.0
**NOTES:**
Believe it or not, this was one of the most boring coding sessions of my life. Also, I know I said that next was making a better tutorial, but next is probably not that because I'm too lazy. I did add support for different types of chocolate. It took forever because of all the things that I didn't think of when I first made all of the game's systems. I probably should've used OOP.

**FEATURES:**
* Added the Boxes project, which makes a better reputation for more money spent
* Added a visual for reputation
* Changed debug key to {I} so *some hackers* will be confused
* Added support for other chocolates (XTRACHOCOLATE in the code)

**BUGS:**
* Fixed font issues
* Made it so info bubbles don't appear when you've already looked at them
* Fixed fatal issue with the seller changing feature


### ALPHA v0.6.0
**NOTES:**
Worker pay was really, really messed up. I'm sorry, it was a nightmare to debug. You know what I had to do to make the workers pay increase correctly? Instead of doing the
simple thing (worker pay + 0.1), I had to this: (worker pay - -0.1). Yep, subtracting by a negative number.

Also, I was dumb and updated my computer with the update log not saved, so I was in the middle of making this update and I had no idea what I changed cause I lost all the info. I had to compare v0.5.6 to the code saved on my hard drive. If only I was smarter. :/

**FEATURES:**
* Changed Kacao Kulture back to Cacao Culture because it looked weird
* Added the Donuts project
* Made the workers slower
* Reworked the worker pay system (the workers are done, I promise)
* Replaced the worker tooltip with visuals that show both data points

**BUGS:**
* Fixed bug where workers still work when their pay is $0.00
* Fixed floating-point rounding errors in the worker pay (0.5 == 0.498758937)
* Fixed that annoying issue where you could scroll down just a little

### ALPHA patch v0.5.6
**FEATURES:**
* Added a debug menu (press D)


**BUGS:**
* Version name says the right thing now

### ALPHA edit v0.5.5
**NOTES:**
I recieved some excellent feedback from my team of testers (aka friends) Next is creating a more comprehensive tutorial.

**FEATURES:**
* Added AutoBuyers, a new project that automatically buys ingredients when you run out
* Finalized the workers
* Changed "Cacao Culture" to "Kacao Kulture" because why not


**BUGS:**
* Switched the place of milk and cacao again because now it looks weird
* Fixed issue where you can't buy extra power

### ALPHA v0.5.0
**FEATURES:**
* Added worker pay
* Created a more comprehensive tutorial
* Added three new companies
* Columns now show a locked screen, "Unlocked at $69" or whatever
* Added the version number as a display


**BUGS:**
* Fixed issue where the money only update on each click of the chocolate
* Switched the places of milk and cacao so people would stop thinking "Milo's Cacao Co." is the name of your shop
* Adjusted time the bytes menu appears to stop players going bankrupt
* Worker project box now displays the correct value

### ALPHA v0.4.0
**FEATURES:**
* Added functionality to the seller change feature
* Added bubbles detailing the byte mining process
* Created MARKETING, an important variable that changes how many customers you can get
* Adjusted prices


**BUGS:**
* Fixed display issue with chocolate tooltip
* Added a $ sign to worker price updates
* Removed the boxes project, which does nothing

### ALPHA patch v0.3.1
**FEATURES:**
* Made worker price increase over time


**BUGS:**
* Fixed fatal error where setting chocolate price to -$0.00 resulted in the game breaking
* Changed the price of workers to $75

### ALPHA v0.3.0
